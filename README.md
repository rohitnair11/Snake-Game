<img src="images/snake_game.gif"/>

This is a simple Snake Game built using the SDL library. The game can be played by using the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake. A Main Menu is added to the game that has three choices: 1. Play the Game, 2. Get Player Statistics and 3. Quit. If the user selects 1, then the user is asked to enter their name and the game is started. When the game terminates, the game data is written to an external file. The highest score of the player is also displayed. When the user selects option 2, all the player data with their scores is displayed after reading it from an external file.  

The program is separated into different functions for each task and also multiple control structures are used. The player data is stored in an external file called `records.txt` and also the data is read from it. The code is present in `record.cpp` file.
